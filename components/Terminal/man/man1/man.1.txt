[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
    [1mman[0m is the system's manual pager.
    The page argument given to [1mman[0m is normally the name of a program, utility, or function.
    The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.
    A section, if provided, will direct [1mman[0m to look only in that section of the manual.
    The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if the page exists in several sections.

    The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.
    All sections contain `intro`, which provides a preface to the section.

    1  Executable programs or shell commands
    4  Special files
    5  File formats and conventions
    6  Games
    7  Miscellaneous

[1mDEFAULTS[0m
    The order of sections to search is as follows:

            1 2 3 4 5 6 7
